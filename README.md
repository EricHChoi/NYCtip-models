# Predictive Modeling for NYC Uber Tips

This project focuses on building a predictive model to analyze and determine the best predictors of ridersâ€™ tip percentages in NYC Uber trips. By leveraging Apache Spark and advanced machine learning algorithms, the model was trained on an extensive dataset containing 18 million records of Uber trip data, capturing various features such as trip distance, duration, time of day, and more.

**Project Overview**

**Objective:** To develop a predictive model that identifies key factors influencing tip percentages in NYC Uber trips, providing insights that can optimize the tipping experience for drivers and riders.

**Approach:**
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Managed and cleaned large-scale trip data using SQL and Apache Spark.
- Feature Engineering: Enhanced the dataset by creating relevant features and applying data transformations.
- Model Building: Implemented multiple regression models, including Vanilla, LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net, to identify the best predictors of tip percentages.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality and improve model performance.
- Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy and predictive power through cross-validation and error metrics.
**Key Features**
- Scalable Data Processing: Handled 18 million records using Apache Spark for efficient data processing and manipulation.
- Advanced Machine Learning: Applied multiple regression techniques to identify significant predictors of tipping behavior.
- Insightful Visualizations: Generated visualizations to explore tipping patterns and the influence of various trip characteristics.
